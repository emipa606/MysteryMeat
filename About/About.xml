Colonists no longer telepathically know the exact ingredients of their mystery meat meal, even if it&apos;s their fellow colonists!

This is my very first mod so help with finding incompatabilities and tips are appreciated!

Changes some colonist thoughts related to human meat meals to be slightly more realistic, colonists will no longer be able to telepathically know what is in their meals.
&quot;Cooked cannibalism -25&quot; has been switched to &quot;Mystery meat -4&quot;

Now only the cook who butchered the corpse themselves knows that it happened.
&quot;We butchered humanlike -6&quot; has been altered to &quot;Suspicious &apos;Hey, where are they taking that corpse?&apos; -1&quot;

To add balance I have nerfed the &quot;cooked cannibalism&quot; mood buff from +15 mood to +9 mood.

This mod is intended for players who prefer a &quot;soylent green&quot; approach to colony food management.
